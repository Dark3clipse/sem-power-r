# Power Analysis for SEM models in R

This project contains R functions to generate data for structural equation modeling. This functionality can be used to run simulations in order to estimate power or required sample size.


The code in this project is written as generic as possible although some assumptions are made, including:
* All regression path coefficients are equal
* All factor loadings are equal
* All latent factors have an equal number of indicators.

*Disclaimer:* Some parts of the code may be tailored to a specific use case. This will probably change in future updates.
